            <p>
             Kevin is an eighth grade student studying on Vancouver Island. He is delighted to be the chair of UNSC at this conference. Before he attended his first conference in 2019, he had heard incredible things about the joys of arguing with a bunch of strangers. Since participating in VYMUN 2019 he has been looking for every opportunity he could get to talk about real and fictional global issues. Other than participating in debate, Kevin can very easily be found swimming and being frustrated with not being able to make provincial times, desperately trying to catch up to large amounts of homework and expectations, as well as observing true crime and watching older horror movies. He is very excited to be joining in on this adventure.

              Cindy is a grade 8 student studying on Vancouver Island. She is thrilled to be serving as the director of the UNHRC this year. Before her first conference in 2020, she believed Model UN was arguing with people which she enjoyed already, but later discovered her true passion for MUN and debate. From settling fictional conflicts to current world issues, every single conference she attends creates bonds and memories that will stay with her forever. Outside of doing Model UN conferences, you can find Cindy playing piano and watching serial killer documentaries with her dog Rue. Cindy is really looking forward to ZMUN 2022 and meeting everyone!

              Manon is a grade 8 student currently studying on Vancouver Island. She is very excited to be chairing UNHRC, and is eager to get to listen to some interesting debate. Model UN has become more then just debate for Manon, it has become a way for her to explore the world by representing and researching various different countries. Outside of conferences, Manon can be found on the soccer field, or running on a local track. She enjoys her sports alongside spending valuable time with her friends. Reading is another one of her passions, and she is an avid murder mystery reader. She hopes to meet new people and further her debate skills at ZMUN 2022!
