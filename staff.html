            <p>
             Kevin is an eighth grade student studying on Vancouver Island. He is delighted to be the chair of UNSC at this conference. Before he attended his first conference in 2019, he had heard incredible things about the joys of arguing with a bunch of strangers. Since participating in VYMUN 2019 he has been looking for every opportunity he could get to talk about real and fictional global issues. Other than participating in debate, Kevin can very easily be found swimming and being frustrated with not being able to make provincial times, desperately trying to catch up to large amounts of homework and expectations, as well as observing true crime and watching older horror movies. He is very excited to be joining in on this adventure.

             A Grade 10 student at St. Patrick’s School, Maya Nino is thrilled to be serving as the UNHRC Chair at ZMUN 2022 and cannot wait to watch the conference come to fruition. Starting her Model UN exploration in Grade 8, then rising to the House of Commons, MUN sparked her interest in Canadian politics and global affairs and allowed her to collaborate with people from all around the globe. Throughout her years engaging in MUN, she grew to appreciate the challenge of global cooperation and diplomacy. Beyond the committee room, Maya can be found playing basketball and soccer with her friends, competitively swimming, practicing taekwondo, playing the piano, or shopping.  She looks forward to an engaging and exciting weekend of leadership and debate. She can’t wait to meet everyone!
